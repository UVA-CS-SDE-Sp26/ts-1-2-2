Command Line Interface Design (Role A)

Purpose: The user interface, or in this case the command line, should take the user input
and run the program with the correct specifications. The user should be able to run the program
from the command line.

Rules
- The program should be run from the TopSecret class, using the command 'java topsecret'
- The program accepts up to two parameters
- One of the parameters should be a number corresponding to a file
- The second parameter can be a specific alternate key to use when deciphering the contents
of the file

Behavior
- 0 arguments: java topsecret - enumerate the available files (ex. 01 filea.txt)
- 1 argument: java topsecret [fileNumber] - the contents of said file should be displayed
using the default key
- 2 arguments: java topsecret [fileNumber] [alternateKey] - the content of the file should be
deciphered using the alternate key
- If an incorrect argument is provided, then the program will display an error message

An error has occurred if:
- The user provides more than two arguments - ("Error: The user may only provide up to two
arguments: a file number and an alternate key")
