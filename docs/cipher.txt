Cipher Module Design (Role D) 

Purpose:
The Cipher module is responsible for converting ciphered text into readable plaintext.
It accepts input text and applies a character substitution cipher using a key file.

Cipher Key Format:
The cipher key is stored in ciphers/key.txt.
The file contains exactly two lines:
- Line 1: plaintext characters
- Line 2: corresponding cipher characters

Example:
ABCDEF
QWERTY

Each character in line 2 maps to the character at the same index in line 1.

Validation Rules:
- Both lines must exist
- Both lines must be the same length
- No duplicate characters are allowed
- The cipher must be one-to-one

Behavior:
- If no alternate key is provided, the default key file is used
- If an alternate key path is provided, it is loaded instead
- If the cipher is invalid, an error is returned
- Characters not found in the cipher are returned unchanged

Responsibilities:
- Load cipher from file
- Validate cipher structure
- Decipher text
- Provide clean API for ProgramControl

The Cipher module does not read data files or handle user input directly.
