Program Control Interface Design (C)

Purpose: Coordination of program flow by interpreting the user's input. It will request data from the file handler
and display the deciphered text.

Rules:
- When the program is executed with no arguments, a list of files and a corresponding number should be provided.
- When the program is executed with a number (corresponding to a file), the contents of the file must be displayed correctly as text.

Testing:
1) Ensure that the first argument given is an available file. There are 3 total files.
   - If the user enters 4: "Error, this file does not exist." Restart the program.
   - If the user enters a non-integer value: "Error, this is not an integer." Restart the program.
2) Ensure that the program works when no arguments are given.
   - If the user enters "java topsecret", a list of each file with a corresponding number should be returned.
3) Ensure that the file contents are correct.
   - If the user properly selects a file, the file contents should print immediately and the program should end.
4) Ensure that the cipher works.
   - If no alternate key is provided: Default key file is provided and deciphers the text.
   - If an alternate key is provided: The alternate key is successfully loaded and used to decipher the text.
   - The ciphers should also correctly decipher the text.
